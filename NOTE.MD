# 📌 Project Notice
XreatOptimizer was originally developed for a hosting promotion and involved rapid prototyping. During early development, AI-assisted tooling was used to help generate boilerplate code, logging structures, and initial feature drafts.

All AI-generated components are being reviewed, refactored, or replaced to ensure code clarity, maintainability, and predictable behavior.

The project is currently under limited maintenance. Within the next 2–3 months, we plan to archive the current implementation and rebuild the system with a cleaner architecture and fully reviewed codebase.

Development activity may be slower as our team is currently focused on academic and real-life commitments.

Transparency and community review are welcomed.

We remove Branding messages and etc.
